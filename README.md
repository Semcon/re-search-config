# Re-Search Extension Configuration

This is the configuration for the various extensions and sites used in the [Re-search project](http://semcon.com/re-search).

This repository is used to defined what engines we should detect and what terms we should detect on those engines.

It also provides a great and open way to view the history of this project.

If you find some term that looks off, please submit a PR.
